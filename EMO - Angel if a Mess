EMO - Angel of a Mess

PG2 Lyric 

Could have been, my girlfriend, my girlfriend. (Little baby it has to end.)
Could have been, the only one, my only one. (My biggest fan.)
Could of been the one for Ree, only one for Ree. (Big baby it has to end.)

I’ll play, pretend, bully, for you to block me babe. (I hate today.) (I’ll play angel do you to love me babe.)
Could have been, my girlfriend, but big baby it had to end. (Until the end.)
You were weighing down my a-consciousness, my a-consciousness. (I’m an angel of a mess.)
You could have been the one for Ree, only one for Ree, only one for me.


Oh no, not again.

Could’nt of been my girlfriend, my spider-queen, my only queen. 
Could’nt of been the only one for you, for you and me, you and me. 
Could’nt of been my remedy, to all these things, all of the things. 
Could’nt of been the only one for ree, the only one for ree. 

(I hate my life.)

I promise there’s nothing about us. Deserves exist!
You hate it when you’re on there my camera. You stupid bitch. 
You hate it when i’m on there, their cameras. I prayed for this riff! 
Baby. Baby i’m so sorry you could’ve been. 

I’ll play pretend, I’m the bully, for you to please block me babe please block me babe. 
You were weighing down my angel of a head, i’m an angel for a head. AREN’T YOU FROM HELL. 
Could have been the only one for Ree, only one for me. Just you us me.
But lady please, lay for me, please lay for me, don’t leave today.
