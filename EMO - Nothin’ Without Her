EMO - Nothin’ Without Her
PG2
Lyric

i think about her, about her.
When you’re not theirs around her, around her.
Baby! i think i like her, i like her.
When you’re not theirs around her, around her. 

There’s something about her, about her.
That makes me feel I matter, I don’t matter. 
Yeah I think love her, I love her. 
There’s something about her, about her.
Baby, I think about her, about her
When you’re not theirs around her, around her. 

I’ve fallen in love with, the most beautiful.
The most beautiful creation, creamation. 
There’s nothing, about her, about her.
That I’d ever change.

Hey! I love her! 
There’s something about her, about her.
Baby, I think about her, about her.
I think I’m in love with her, I’m in love with her. 

For i think, without her i cannot appreciate my life Baby Baby Baby.
There’s something about her, that I think i like. 

For i think about her, for i’m nothing without her, Bekka i think i like her, Bekka i think I love her. 

I’m nothing without her, i’m lost here without her Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby!
i think about her, for i’m lost here without her. 
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby!!
I think about you. 

I’m nothing without you, I’m a nothing without you.
