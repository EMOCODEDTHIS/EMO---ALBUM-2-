EMO - Letty 

PG2 Lyric 
It’s what you do to me, it’s what you say to me, i have to have you here can’t have you up and leave. 
Can’t you have up and leave, float away like i’m dyin’ leaves, dyin’ leaves.
i need you just as much, as i’m smokin’ trees, smokin’ trees, smoking trees. 
i need you just as much, as i’m trying to breathe, trying to breathe, trying to breathe. 

Letty i’m so sorry for the ways i think, Ann the words i say.
Letty i’m so sorry for the words i don’t say, when you’re close anyway. 
I’m so in love with my ghost girlfriend, my ghost girlfriend. 
Letty i’m so sorry, for the way it ends, it has to end. 

Letty i’m so in love with my ghost girlfriend, my newest friend.
Letty i want you just as much as my life to end, my life to end, my life to end.
Why won’t you let you & me co-exist, co-exist.
Letty is it just as friends well i’m smoking trees, i’m smoking trees!

i need you just as much, as my art to breathe, my heart to breathe, why is it hard to breathe? 
Why won’t you, let me be, let me be, let me be. 
Letty i love you so much, more than friends, more then friends.

It’s what you do to me, it’s what you say to me, I have to have you here have you here to stay. 
Lettty I’m so into it, and i’m so interested in the way you live.

I need you as much, these cuts need me, these cuts need me. 
I need you just as much as you my heart to breathe, if you want my heart to breathe.
