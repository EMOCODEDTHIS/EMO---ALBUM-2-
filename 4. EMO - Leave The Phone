Stop paging the phone, 
won’t you stop paging my phone, 
won’t you stop paging this phone, 
won’t you stop to leave me alone.

I don’t want you right here.
I don’t want you in my fall.
I don’t want you at all. 
0:15 - 0:22
So
Stop paging my phone, please stop paging this phone, won’t you stop to leave me alone, won’t you stop to leave me alone. 
0:23 - 0:31
I don’t want you right here.
I don’t want you at all. 
I don’t want you in my fall.
There’s no knocking on a door. 
0:31 - 0:47
Just to let me be an all alone.
When I’m smoking my stoges, when i’m holding to this board & I’m holding’ on to ropes.
Just to let me be an all alone  Baby when , in that dying in that restroom, in that stenching restroom retro’s dying all alone.
0:47 - 1:21
If she doesn’t love me, then she doesn’t want me. I should not hate myself, I should not go hang myself.
If she doesn’t love me, then she doesn’t love me. i think I’ll be alright, I think i’ll be just fine. 
If she doesn’t want me, then she doesn’t want me. I should not hang around not hang my head.
If she doesn’t love me, then she doesn’t love me, it’s going to be okay Baby.
1:21 - 1:46
If she doesn’t want me, if she doesn’t love me, I might just go hang my head. 
Baby. What’s the problem if I’m so in love with you and want to solve your problems. 
Lil’ Baby that’s the problem, Baby, I have no problems, & I don’t want no problems.
Baby that’s the problem, you have no problems, I should make your problems.
1:46 ~
Baby that’s the problem, baby I don’t want no problems, baby I don’t want you my problem, i don’t want you my problem. 
I just wanted to have a simple life with one woman with her simple problems.
