EMO - Hate U No More’

PG2 Lyric

I don’t want to hate you no more. 
For the new air I am now breathing. 
For the hero we are now breathing. 
Need you to understand the words I’m screaming.’ 
Don’t come around with you’re lying, and cheating. 
Need you to understand the words I’m sayin’.
Don’t come around with lying, and cheating. 
Forever I won’t hate you as my girl friend! (Consciousness.)
I won’t want you no-more! 
Forever I won’t date you my girl friend. (Consciousness.)
I don’t want to hear you no more. 
Why are you always out-weighing my consciousness.
I don’t want to hear you no more. 
Ho-oh. 
Ho-oh-oh-no.
Mmm.
Mmm-mmm.
Mmm.

I still, don’t want you around. 
I don’t gotta have you as my only shorty.
I can have nobody’s else, I don’t want some-body else. 
Like obviously:
I don’t still, need you around.
I don’t gotta keep you as my only shorty. 
I can’t have nobody’s else, I don’t want nobody else. 

Mmm.
Mmm-mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm-mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm-mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm-mmm.

Forever however I’ve loved you my girl friend! 
I won’t want to see you no-more! 
Forever however I dated you my girl friend.
I don’t want to date you no more. 

Like Heroin: Am I breathing?
Like Suzy Ann: I’m not eating. 
Like obviously: I’m not cheating. 
Like the hero in me is not breathing. 
Mmm.
