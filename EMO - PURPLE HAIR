Purple hair, i know for sure, gotta to ask you be my girlfriend.
You’re the broad that i’d like to know, ugly lady can you hear this!
You’re that broad, that i’d love to know, pretty lady, can you hear this? 

You’re purple hair.
And those glasses that you’d wear.
While workin’ your art, was i a walkin’ adead.

You’re that broad that i’d like to know pretty lady can you hear me!
You’re that broad that i like for-short, baby baby, can you hear me?
You’re that broad that i love for-short, you deserve to hate me, hate me.
You’re that broad that i want for a short, you deserve to date me, date me.

I’m a stupid boy.
With a stupid toy. (Fuck this guitar.)
She hates these noise.
She hates my choice.  

i hate my life, what’s so good of a, of a rockstar these days.
Purple hair, i know you’re now happy today. 
Purple hair, purple hair, what’s it got to do anyway.
Purple hair, purple hair, purple hair, heard you’re now a mom anyway. 

You’re that broad that i’d love for-sure, purple hair gurl can you hear me feelins’!
You’re that broad that i’d love for-sure, my applejax in the mourning. 
You’re that broad that i’d love to know, purple hair can you feed me cigarettes.
You’re that broad that i want for home.

Her purple hair.
Her emo hair.
Her emo stair.
